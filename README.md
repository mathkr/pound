## Pound

Pound was born out of the nonsensical wish to solve a programming assignment
that involves printing a matrix of '#' and '_' characters in a specific manner
in a programming language that can be programmed by only using '#' and '_'
characters.

Pound is a stackmachine that runs on the bytecode generated by its
bytecode generator (Duh!).

Numbers are represented in binary but instead of
'0' and '1', '_' and '#' are used.

_ := 0
# := 1

Numeric constants can have up to 7 bits. The exact length of the tokens in the
assembly code matters (labels: 4 bits, instructions: 3 bits, numbers: 7 bits).
Don't pad with zeros ('_').

The stack grows upwards (the bigger the stackpointer, the larger the stack).
The stackpointer always points to the next empty address above the stack.

sp := stackpointer

In the following documentation the value at a given position on the stack is
denoted by giving the stack address (e.g. sp or sp-1) and prefixing it with the
dereferencing operator used in c (*).

This means:

*(sp-1) -> The topmost value on the stack.
*(sp-2) -> The second value on the stack.

etc.

Generally all instructions consume their arguments. This means, that if our
stack looks like this:

```
0 5 7
      ^
      |
      stackpointer
```

and we execute an 'add' operation our stack will look like this:

```
0 12
     ^
     |
     stackpointer
```

There are 32 registers which can be accessed by their addresses. They can be
used to saveglobal variables. There is no RAM at this point.

### Instruction table

```
+=============+==========+==============================================+
| Instruction | Mnemonic | Explanation                                  |
+-------------+----------+----------------------------------------------+
| NNNNNNN     | psh      | Pushes N (7 bits) onto the stack.            |
| ___         | nop      | Does nothing.                                |
| __#         | pop      | Decreases the sp.                            |
| _#_         | add      | Adds two numbers from the stack.             |
| _##         | sub      | Subtracts *(sp-1) from *(sp-2).              |
| #__         | ldr      | Pushes from register *(sp-1).                |
| #_#         | wtr      | Writes *(sp-2) to register *(sp-1).          |
| ##_         | jmp      | Jumps to *(sp-1) if *(sp-2) is zero.         |
| ###         | out      | Prints the ASCII value of *(sp-1) to stdout. |

### Labels

Labels consist of a 4 bit number and are denoted by putting them directly in
the beginning of a line, followed by one or multiple whitespaces and then an
instruction. All lines without a label have to have at least one whitespace
character at the beginning of the line.

### Usage

./bytecode_generator mycode.pound | ./stackmachine

### Example

Print the numbers from 0 - 9 (mnemonics and clarifications in comments):

```
; r0
     _##____    ; 48       the current numbers ascii value
     _______
     #_#        ; wtr

; main:
____ _______    ; 0        output current ascii value
     #__        ; ldr
     ###        ; out

     _______    ; 0        increment current ascii value
     #__        ; ldr
     ______#    ; 1
     _#_        ; add
     _______    ; 0
     #_#        ; wtr

     _####__    ; 58       48 + 10
     _______    ; 0
     #__        ; ldr      load r0
     _##        ; sub      58 - r0
     ___#       ; end
     ##_        ; jmp      jmp if (58 - r0) is equal to zero

     _______    ; 0
     ____       ; main
     ##_        ; jmp

; end:
___# ___        ; nop
```

### Random notes

Labels can only map to instructions up _####### (2^7 - 1) because the first bit
in each instruction is reserved for push instructions. This means, that in
practice programs get too big very fast!
